== Description ==

Unlike traditional comment systems, HyperComments allows to comment on a specific word or text fragment.

**How Hypercomments work:**<br />
Readers select a word or a fragment of text that caught their attention and comment on it.
The fragment is now highlighted and clickable. Highlighting attracts readers' attention. 
HyperComments will engage your audience in a discussion and encourage them to comment more.
